# OpenSimCurrencyModule (for dotnet 6)

This project contains the slightly modified parts of code written in C# to be used in [BigManzais's Opensim Currency Server 2023](https://github.com/BigManzai/OpenSimCurrencyServer-2023). 

The code here does only contain the parts of the Money Server Module written in C# and the Prebuild  configuration required to build and compile this code as an addon-module in the OpenSimulator build process for _dotnet 6_.

To use this code, simply copy the three modules from the addon-modules folder to the opensim/addon-modules directory. Then use runprebuild followed by compile to compile the code into the opensim/bin directory.

The code here will NOT be maintained. It will be removed as soon it's no longer needed.

Look at https://github.com/BigManzai/OpenSimCurrencyServer-2023 if you are interested in the complete project.
